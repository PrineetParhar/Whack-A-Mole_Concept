# Whack-A-Mole_Concept
 This is the first game I have ever made with the Python module "Pygame". Hope you enjoy playing this Whack-A-Mole Concept Game!

Directions:
	1. Download the zip folder version of this project, then extract it so you have a working folder.
	2. Click on the application to view the actual game. 
	3. Make sure to move the pygame window out of the way, the final score of the game will be displayed on the black console, so don't have the pygame window block the console!
	4. Enjoy the game! Challenge your friends to see who can beat your high score!
